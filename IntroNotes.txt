1. How do we run code the code in our project?
---> go run ->NAME OF FILE<- EX: go run main.go
go run complies and executes one or two files
go build compiles a bunch og go souece code files (kind of like gcc for C) and then to run/execute this you type ./executable file (i.e. ./main)

2. What does 'package main' mean?
Package == Project == Workspace
package main defines a package that can be complied and executed MUST HAVE A FUNC CALLED MAIN "main is special"
another package that is not package main is a reusbale package, defines a package that can be used a depedency (helper code)

3. What does 'import "fmt"' mean?
It means give the current package you are working access to another package called "fmt"
"fmt" is a standard library package that is inclided in the Go language
"fmt" is most commonly used to print stuff out
kind of like "import stdio.h" (header files in C)

4. What's that 'func' thing?
func is short for 'function'
func tells Go we're about to declare a function
the 'main' after func sets the name of the function
the '()' after main is the list of argumenets to pass to the function

5. How is the main.go file organized?
    1. Package declaration
    2. Import other packages that we need
    3. Declare function, tell Go to do things

Array: fixed length list of things
Slice: An array that can grow or shrink 

Structs: Data Structure, collection of properties that are related together
